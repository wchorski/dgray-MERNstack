# âš™ Development Setup Checklist
0. i run <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community">MongoDB Community Edition</a> locally on my machine and tap into it with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass">MongoDB Compass</a> 
0. add in `require('dotenv').config();` at the top of `./server/server.js`
0. allow multiple frontend domains in `allowedOrigins.js` (docker compose env variable gets added automatically)
0. node dev environment `cd ./server` `npm run dev` will kick up express and react at the same time.
0. you could run a dev environment in docker with `dev.sh` but I don't recommend it.
0. all dev env variables live in `./server/.env` & `./client/.env` (production variables are setup via compose)
<br/>

# âš™ Production Setup Checklist
0. copy `compose.example.yml` to `compose.yml` and configure *SECURE* variables
0. comment out `require('dotenv').config();` at the top of `./server/server.js`
0. change `./client/.env` with prod variables
0. edit all `environment:` variables in `compose.yml`
0. `docker compose up -d --build`
0. `docker compose down --remove-orphans`
