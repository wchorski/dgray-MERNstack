# âš™ Development Setup Checklist
0. i run <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community">MongoDB Community Edition</a> locally on my machine and tap into it with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass">MongoDB Compass</a> 
0. copy `./server/.env.dev` to `./server/.env`
0. copy `./client/.env.dev` to `./client/.env`
0. allow multiple frontend domains in `allowedOrigins.js` (docker compose env variable gets added automatically)
0. node dev environment `cd ./server` `npm run dev` will kick up express and react at the same time.
0. you could run a dev environment in *docker* with `dev.sh` but I don't recommend it.
<br/>

# âš™ Production Setup Checklist
0. copy and edit`./client/.env.prod` to `./client/.env`
0. copy `compose.example.yml` to `compose.yml` and configure *SECURE* `environment: ` variables
0. *client's* variables still set in `./client/.env`
0. `docker compose up -d --build` | `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to take everything down

## Nginx Proxy Manager setup
0. setup proxy host. example `app.mywebsite.com`
0. 'Details' tab -> host name is local IP and port is *client's* external Port in `compose.yml`
0. 'Custom location' tab -> API server set here 'location' set as `/api/`
0. ^ 'forward hostname/IP' = `192.168.0.100/` | 'forward port' = *server's* external Port`compose.yml`
