# âš™ Development Setup Checklist
0. allow your frontend domain in `allowedOrigins.js`
0. node dev environment `cd ./server` `npm run dev` will kick up express and react at the same time.
0. ^ i run <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community">MongoDB Community Edition</a> locally on my machine and tap into it with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass">MongoDB Compass</a> 
0. you could run a dev environment in docker with `dev.sh` but I don't recommend it.
0. all dev env variables live in `./server.env` & `./client.env` (production variables are setup via compose)
